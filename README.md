## What is EVA?

EVA is a visual data management system (think MySQL for videos). It supports a declarative language similar to SQL and a wide range of commonly used  computer vision models.

## What does EVA do?

* EVA **enables querying of visual data** in user facing applications by providing a simple SQL-like interface for a wide range of commonly used computer vision models.

* EVA **improves throughput** by introducing sampling, filtering, and caching techniques.

* EVA **improves accuracy** by introducing state-of-the-art model specialization and selection algorithms.

## Installation

Installation of EVA involves setting a virtual environment using [miniconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) and configuring git hooks.

1. Clone the repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/georgia-tech-db/eva.git
```

2. Install the dependencies.
```shell
sh script/install/before_install.sh
export PATH="$HOME/miniconda/bin:$PATH"
sh script/install/install.sh
```

3. Connect mysql user root with normal account and no password
```mysql
sudo mysql -u root
> SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;
> DROP USER 'root'@'localhost';
> CREATE USER 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '';
> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql -u root
```
refer to [askubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/questions/766334/cant-login-as-mysql-user-root-from-normal-user-account-in-ubuntu-16-04)

4. Install `docker` and `docker-compose`.
Please refer to [official doc](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

## Docker

1. Standup EVA testing for CPU/GPU hardware.
```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml eva-test-[cpu/gpu] up
```

## Development

1. Install git hooks in your .git/ directory. [optional, but recommended]
```shell
conda activate eva
pre-commit install
```

2. Ensure that all the unit test cases (including the ones you have added) run succesfully and the coding style conventions are followed.

```shell
bash script/test/test.sh
```

## Architecture

EVA consists of four core components:

* EVAQL Query Parser
* Query Optimizer
* Query Execution Engine (Filters + Deep Learning Models)
* Distributed Storage Engine
